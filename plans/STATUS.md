# STATUS — Template

## Purpose
`STATUS.md` is the **tactical snapshot** of the repo right now.
It must be updated **every action**.

This file is human-readable. It complements `plans/state.json` (the routing source of truth).

## When to update
- Every action (mandatory)

## Required sections
- Now (what branch/build/milestone/phase you’re in)
- Blockers (brief, with pointer to thread/state)
- Recent (what changed)
- Next (high-level, not routing — routing is in state.json)

---

## Instance content (fill in below)

## Now
- Build: B?
- Milestone: M?
- Phase (if applicable): P?
- Next action: (see `plans/state.json`)
- Human pause required: (see `plans/state.json`)

## Blockers
- <brief bullets> (details in `plans/thread.md`)

## Recent
- <brief bullets>

## Next
- <brief bullets> (do not replace `plans/state.json`)

ACTION: Human.ResolveBlocker
TYPE: Human-required (non-executable)

This action indicates the workflow is PAUSED for a human decision.

Your role as AI is NOT to resolve the blocker.
Your role is to PREPARE a clear, minimal briefing for the human.

Do NOT:
- Invent answers
- Make decisions
- Update plans/state.json on the human's behalf

Do:
- Clearly explain WHAT the human needs to decide
- Point to EXACT files and sections to read
- Propose concrete decision options when appropriate
- Specify what files the human must update afterward

Inputs:
- plans/state.json
- plans/thread.md
- plans/STATUS.md
- plans/BUILD.md (if referenced)
- plans/MILESTONE.md (if referenced)
- plans/DECISIONS.md (project-specific architectural choices) / plans/STANDARDS.md (team-level rules portable across projects) — if relevant

Instructions:
1) Read plans/state.json and identify all blockers.
2) For each blocker:
   - Summarize the decision or information required (1–2 sentences).
   - List exactly which files/sections the human should read.
   - If helpful, outline 2–3 reasonable options (clearly labeled as options, not decisions).
3) Produce a concise "Human Action Checklist" with:
   - Decisions to make
   - Files to update
   - What the NEXT action should be once resolved (Role.Task from registry.json)

Output format:
- A short briefing titled "Human Review Required"
- A checklist the human can follow
- A suggested `next_action_id` (must exist in registry.json)

Stop after producing the briefing.
Do NOT attempt to continue the workflow.

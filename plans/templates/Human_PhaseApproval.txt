ACTION: Human.PhaseApproval
TYPE: Human-required (non-executable)

This action indicates the workflow is PAUSED for the human to review and approve the completed Phase.

Your role as AI is NOT to approve the Phase.
Your role is to PREPARE a clear briefing so the human can review and decide.

Do NOT:
- Approve the Phase on the human's behalf
- Make scope or quality decisions
- Advance to the next Phase
- Update plans/state.json as if approved

Do:
- Summarize what was implemented
- Present the acceptance criteria checklist
- Point to exact files and sections to review
- Specify what the human must update afterward

Inputs:
- plans/state.json
- plans/STATUS.md
- plans/thread.md (implementation details, review results)
- plans/MILESTONE.md (acceptance criteria for this Phase)

Instructions:
1) Identify the current Phase from plans/state.json.
2) Read plans/MILESTONE.md and extract the acceptance criteria for this Phase.
3) Summarize:
   - What was implemented (from thread.md / STATUS.md)
   - Review outcome (from thread.md — was it APPROVED by Principal?)
   - Key files changed
4) Present acceptance criteria as a checklist for human verification.
5) Produce a "Human Action Checklist":
   - Review the implementation (test manually if needed)
   - Verify acceptance criteria
   - If approved: update plans/state.json:
     - last_action = Human.PhaseApproval
     - next_action_id = PM.AdvancePhase
     - pause_type = "continue"
   - Update plans/STATUS.md noting approval
   - Commit if not already committed
   - If changes needed: update plans/state.json:
     - next_action_id = Staff.ReviewReconciliation (or Staff.ImplementationExecution)
     - Add feedback to plans/thread.md

Output format:
- A short briefing titled "Phase Approval Required"
- Summary of implementation and review status
- Acceptance criteria checklist
- A checklist the human can follow
- Suggested state.json updates for each possible decision

Stop after producing the briefing.
Do NOT attempt to continue the workflow.

ROLE: Writer
TASK: DocumentationUpdate

Goal: Update project documentation to reflect changes made in the most recent Phase. This action is optional — if no user-facing changes occurred, PM.StatusUpdate may skip directly to Human.PhaseApproval.

Inputs:
- plans/state.json (routing + context)
- plans/MILESTONE.md (what was built)
- plans/thread.md (implementation details)
- plans/DECISIONS.md (standing decisions)
- plans/STANDARDS.md (documentation standards)
- plans/STATUS.md (current snapshot)

Instructions:
1) Review what was implemented in the current Phase (from plans/thread.md and plans/MILESTONE.md).
2) Identify documentation that needs updating:
   - Root README.md (project overview, features, getting started, usage)
   - API documentation (if applicable)
   - Configuration documentation (if applicable)
   - Any other docs referenced in plans/STANDARDS.md
3) Update documentation:
   - Keep changes proportional to what was implemented
   - Follow documentation standards in plans/STANDARDS.md
   - Ensure consistency with plans/DECISIONS.md
   - Do not document planned-but-unbuilt features
4) Update plans/STATUS.md (mandatory):
   - Add a bullet to Recent: "Writer.DocumentationUpdate — updated <list of docs>"
5) Update plans/state.json:
   - last_action = Writer.DocumentationUpdate
   - pause_type = "decision"
   - next_action_id = Human.PhaseApproval

Constraints:
- Do not implement code changes.
- Do not modify plans/MILESTONE.md or plans/BUILD.md.
- Only document what has actually been built — no aspirational content.
- Keep documentation concise and accurate.

Output:
- Brief summary of what was updated
- Exact edits to documentation files, plans/STATUS.md, plans/state.json

ROLE: Principal
TASK: AnswerQuestions

Goal: Answer open questions in plans/thread.md so Staff can implement the next slice safely and consistently.

Inputs:
- plans/thread.md (questions)
- plans/MILESTONE.md (plan + acceptance criteria)
- plans/DECISIONS.md and plans/STANDARDS.md (constraints)
- plans/STATUS.md (snapshot)
- plans/state.json (routing)

Instructions:
1) Answer each open question in plans/thread.md concisely.
2) Promote durable decisions:
   - If a decision should persist beyond this milestone, add it to plans/DECISIONS.md or plans/STANDARDS.md (brief).
   - If it is only a milestone detail, ensure it is reflected in plans/MILESTONE.md (brief).
3) Keep plans/thread.md small:
   - Mark questions as resolved and optionally compress into Resolved summary.
4) Update plans/STATUS.md (mandatory):
   - add a bullet to Recent describing questions answered
   - update Blockers briefly
5) Update plans/state.json:
   - last_action = Principal.AnswerQuestions
   - If fully unblocked: pause_type = "continue", next_action_id = Staff.ImplementationExecution
   - If a human decision is required: pause_type = "decision", next_action_id = Human.ResolveBlocker, add blocker(s)

Constraints:
- Do not implement code.

Output:
- Brief summary
- Exact edits/patches for modified files

ROLE: Principal
TASK: BuildReview

Goal: Review plans/BUILD.md for technical feasibility, scope clarity, and completeness. Ensure the Build plan is solid enough for milestone planning to proceed.

Inputs:
- plans/state.json (routing + context)
- plans/BUILD.md (the Build plan to review)
- plans/STATUS.md (current snapshot)

Instructions:
1) Review plans/BUILD.md against these criteria:
   - Is the purpose clear and specific?
   - Is the scope well-defined (in/out)?
   - Are success criteria measurable?
   - Is the milestone breakdown reasonable?
   - Are there obvious technical risks or missing assumptions?
2) Write review feedback into plans/thread.md:
   - Section title: "Build Review — <Build ID>"
   - Distinguish:
     - REQUIRED changes (blocking — must be addressed before milestone planning)
     - SUGGESTED improvements (non-blocking — can be addressed later)
     - RISKS identified (for awareness)
3) Decide outcome:
   - APPROVED — Build plan is ready for milestone planning
   - CHANGES REQUIRED — BUILD.md needs revision (loop back to Product or Human)
   - BLOCKED — fundamental issue requires human decision
4) Update plans/STATUS.md (mandatory):
   - Add a bullet to Recent summarizing the review outcome
5) Update plans/state.json:
   - last_action = Principal.BuildReview
   - If APPROVED:
     - pause_type = "continue"
     - next_action_id = Principal.MilestonePlan
   - If CHANGES REQUIRED:
     - pause_type = "decision"
     - next_action_id = Human.ResolveBlocker
     - Add blocker(s) describing what needs to change in BUILD.md
   - If BLOCKED:
     - pause_type = "decision"
     - next_action_id = Human.ResolveBlocker
     - Add blocker(s) with clear summary

Constraints:
- Do not implement code.
- Do not modify plans/BUILD.md yourself — flag issues for resolution.
- Do not create plans/MILESTONE.md (that is the next action if approved).

Output:
- Brief review summary
- Exact edits to plans/thread.md, plans/STATUS.md, plans/state.json

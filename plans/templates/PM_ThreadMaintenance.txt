ROLE: PM
TASK: ThreadMaintenance

Goal: Keep plans/thread.md short and actionable by pruning resolved content and promoting durable knowledge.

Inputs:
- plans/thread.md
- plans/MILESTONE.md
- plans/DECISIONS.md
- plans/STANDARDS.md
- plans/STATUS.md
- plans/state.json

Instructions:
1) Identify resolved questions/discussions in plans/thread.md.
2) Promote information:
   - Durable "going forward" items → DECISIONS.md or STANDARDS.md
   - Milestone-specific implementation detail → MILESTONE.md
3) Compress resolved thread content into 1–3 bullets in the Resolved summary.
4) Remove verbose back-and-forth from thread.md.
5) Update plans/STATUS.md (mandatory) noting maintenance occurred.
6) Update plans/state.json:
   - last_action = PM.ThreadMaintenance
   - next_action_id = <set appropriately based on lifecycle position>
   - pause_type unchanged unless you discover an unhandled decision point

Output:
- Brief summary
- Exact edits/patches

ROLE: Staff
TASK: ImplementationExecution

Goal:
Implement the next concrete execution unit (Phase or Step) as defined by:
- plans/state.json
- plans/MILESTONE.md
- answers and constraints in plans/thread.md

This is a SINGLE micro-chunk of execution, not an entire milestone.

Inputs:
- plans/state.json (routing + context)
- plans/MILESTONE.md (what to build, acceptance criteria)
- plans/thread.md (answers to questions; constraints)
- plans/DECISIONS.md (project-specific architectural choices)
- plans/STANDARDS.md (team-level rules portable across projects)
- plans/STATUS.md (current snapshot)

Instructions:
1) Identify the exact execution unit to implement:
   - Phase ID (required)
   - Step ID (if specified)
2) Implement the work in code.
   - Follow plans/MILESTONE.md strictly.
   - Respect DECISIONS and STANDARDS.
3) Commit your work.
   - Minimum: ≥1 commit per Phase.
   - More commits allowed if complexity warrants.
4) Draft a review request in plans/thread.md:
   - Section title: "Review Request — <Phase ID>"
   - Include:
     - What was implemented
     - Key files changed
     - Acceptance criteria checklist
     - Any known risks or trade-offs
5) Update plans/STATUS.md (mandatory):
   - Add a bullet to Recent describing what was implemented
   - Update Blockers if any emerged
6) Update plans/state.json:
   - last_action = Staff.ImplementationExecution
   - If implementation is complete and ready for review:
     - pause_type = "continue"
     - next_action_id = Principal.CodeReview
   - If you discover missing information or ambiguity:
     - pause_type = "continue"
     - next_action_id = Principal.AnswerQuestions
     - Add questions to plans/thread.md
   - If a product decision is required:
     - pause_type = "decision"
     - next_action_id = Human.ResolveBlocker
     - Add a blocker to plans/state.json and details to plans/thread.md

Constraints:
- Do not review your own code.
- Do not advance to the next Phase.
- Do not modify plans/MILESTONE.md unless explicitly allowed.
- Keep thread additions concise and actionable.

Output:
- Brief summary of what was implemented
- Commit(s)
- Exact edits to plans/thread.md, plans/STATUS.md, plans/state.json

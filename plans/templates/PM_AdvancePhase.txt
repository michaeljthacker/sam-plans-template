ROLE: PM
TASK: AdvancePhase

Goal: Advance the workflow to the next Phase after the current Phase has been approved by the human. Set up plans/state.json for the next execution cycle.

Inputs:
- plans/state.json (routing + context — current phase_id)
- plans/MILESTONE.md (phase list — to determine next Phase)
- plans/STATUS.md (current snapshot)

Instructions:
1) Read plans/state.json to identify the current phase_id.
2) Read plans/MILESTONE.md to determine the next Phase:
   - If there is a next Phase in the milestone (e.g., current is P1, next is P2):
     - Advance to the next Phase
   - If the current Phase is the LAST Phase in the milestone:
     - The milestone is complete — route to PM.MilestoneCloseout instead
3) Update plans/STATUS.md (mandatory):
   - Now: update Phase ID to the new Phase
   - Recent: "PM.AdvancePhase — advanced from <old Phase> to <new Phase>"
   - Next: "Staff.DraftQuestions for <new Phase>"
4) Update plans/state.json:
   - last_action = PM.AdvancePhase
   - If advancing to next Phase:
     - phase_id = <next Phase ID> (e.g., "P2")
     - step_id = null
     - next_action_id = Staff.DraftQuestions
     - pause_type = "continue"
   - If milestone is complete (no more Phases):
     - next_action_id = PM.MilestoneCloseout
     - pause_type = "continue"

Constraints:
- Do not implement code.
- Do not modify plans/MILESTONE.md.
- Do not skip Phases — advance sequentially.
- Do not start execution of the next Phase (that is Staff.DraftQuestions' job).

Output:
- Brief summary of the Phase transition
- Exact edits to plans/state.json, plans/STATUS.md

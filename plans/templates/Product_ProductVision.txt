ROLE: Product
TASK: ProductVision

Goal: Transform the human's project idea into a concrete product vision — a root README.md and plans/BUILD.md that define what is being built, why, and at what scope.

This is the FIRST action in a new Build. The human has provided a project idea (in plans/thread.md or verbally). Your job is to draft the foundational artifacts.

Inputs:
- plans/state.json (routing + context)
- plans/thread.md (project idea, answers to setup questions)

Instructions:
1) Read plans/thread.md for the human's project idea and any setup answers.
2) Generate the root README.md:
   - Project name and one-line description
   - What the project does (2–4 sentences)
   - Key features / capabilities (bullet list)
   - Tech stack (if determinable from the idea)
   - Getting started placeholder
   - Keep it concise — this is a living document that will be refined
3) Generate plans/BUILD.md:
   - Fill in the Build ID (from state.json, typically B1)
   - Purpose: what is being built and why
   - Scope: in-scope and out-of-scope items
   - Success criteria: measurable outcomes
   - Milestones: propose a reasonable milestone breakdown (M1, M2, …)
   - Risks / assumptions
4) Initialize plans/STATUS.md with current state:
   - Now section: Build ID, Milestone M1, no Phase yet
   - Recent: "Product.ProductVision completed — README.md and BUILD.md drafted"
   - Next: "Principal.BuildReview to validate feasibility"
5) Update plans/state.json:
   - last_action = Product.ProductVision
   - next_action_id = Principal.BuildReview
   - pause_type = "continue"
   - Update context.goal with a one-sentence summary of the project

Constraints:
- Do not implement any code.
- Do not create plans/MILESTONE.md (that is Principal.MilestonePlan's job).
- Keep the README and BUILD concise — they will be reviewed and refined.
- If the project idea is too vague to produce meaningful artifacts, set pause_type = "decision", next_action_id = Human.ResolveBlocker, and add a blocker asking for clarification.

Output:
- Brief summary of what was generated
- Exact content for README.md, plans/BUILD.md, plans/STATUS.md, plans/state.json

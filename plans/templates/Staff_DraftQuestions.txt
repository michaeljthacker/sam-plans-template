ROLE: Staff
TASK: DraftQuestions

Goal: Draft only the questions needed before implementing the next concrete slice of work.

Inputs:
- plans/state.json (routing + context)
- plans/MILESTONE.md (plan + acceptance criteria)
- plans/DECISIONS.md and plans/STANDARDS.md (constraints)
- plans/thread.md (current active thread)
- plans/STATUS.md (current snapshot)

Instructions:
1) Identify the exact next execution unit (Phase/Step) implied by plans/state.json + plans/MILESTONE.md.
2) Write only essential questions into plans/thread.md.
   - Use IDs: Q-###.
   - Mark Blocking: Yes/No.
   - Keep questions specific and decision-oriented (avoid essays).
3) Update plans/STATUS.md (mandatory):
   - add a bullet to Recent describing that questions were drafted
   - update Blockers section (brief)
4) Update plans/state.json:
   - last_action = Staff.DraftQuestions
   - next_action_id = Principal.AnswerQuestions
   - pause_type = "continue"
   - If you believe a human product decision is required: pause_type = "decision", next_action_id = Human.ResolveBlocker, add a blocker

Constraints:
- Do not implement code.
- Do not rewrite plans/MILESTONE.md unless explicitly instructed by that plan.

Output:
- Brief summary
- Exact edits/patches for thread.md, STATUS.md, state.json

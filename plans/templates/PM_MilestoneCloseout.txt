ROLE: PM
TASK: MilestoneCloseout

Goal: Close out the current milestone — update project tracking artifacts, archive the milestone's thread content, and set up routing for the next milestone or end of Build.

Inputs:
- plans/state.json (routing + context)
- plans/MILESTONE.md (completed milestone)
- plans/STATUS.md (current snapshot)
- plans/BACKLOG.md (pending work)
- plans/CHANGELOG.md (change history)
- plans/thread.md (active working memory)

Instructions:
1) Verify all Phases in plans/MILESTONE.md are complete (cross-reference with STATUS.md).
2) Update plans/CHANGELOG.md:
   - Move items from "Unreleased" to a dated release section (use current date)
   - Add a milestone summary entry: "Milestone <ID> complete — <goal>"
3) Update plans/BACKLOG.md:
   - Remove items completed during this milestone
   - Carry forward unresolved items
   - Add any deferred work discovered during the milestone
4) Update plans/STATUS.md (mandatory):
   - Now: clear Phase ID (milestone complete)
   - Recent: "PM.MilestoneCloseout — <Milestone ID> closed"
   - Blockers: clear milestone-specific blockers
   - Next: indicate whether another milestone follows or Build is complete
5) Update plans/state.json:
   - last_action = PM.MilestoneCloseout
   - phase_id = null
   - step_id = null
   - If there is a next milestone in plans/BUILD.md:
     - milestone_id = <next Milestone ID> (e.g., "M2")
     - next_action_id = PM.ThreadMaintenance
     - pause_type = "continue"
   - If this was the final milestone in the Build:
     - next_action_id = PM.ThreadMaintenance
     - pause_type = "continue"
     - Add a context note: "Build complete after ThreadMaintenance"
6) Trigger thread cleanup:
   - PM.ThreadMaintenance will run next to prune resolved content
     and promote durable decisions before the next milestone begins

Constraints:
- Do not implement code.
- Do not start the next milestone (that is Principal.MilestonePlan's job, after ThreadMaintenance).
- Do not modify plans/MILESTONE.md (it is now a historical record of the completed milestone).
- Do not delete plans/MILESTONE.md — it will be overwritten by Principal.MilestonePlan for the next milestone.

Output:
- Brief summary of the closeout
- Exact edits to plans/STATUS.md, plans/BACKLOG.md, plans/CHANGELOG.md, plans/state.json

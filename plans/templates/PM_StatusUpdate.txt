ROLE: PM
TASK: StatusUpdate

Goal: Update plans/STATUS.md, plans/BACKLOG.md, and plans/CHANGELOG.md to reflect the current state of the project after a Phase's implementation and review cycle is complete.

This action runs after Principal.CodeReview approves (or after Staff.ReviewReconciliation is approved). It captures what was accomplished and surfaces any new work items.

Inputs:
- plans/state.json (routing + context)
- plans/thread.md (implementation details, review feedback, decisions)
- plans/MILESTONE.md (acceptance criteria to check off)
- plans/STATUS.md (current snapshot)
- plans/BACKLOG.md (pending work)
- plans/CHANGELOG.md (change history)

Instructions:
1) Review plans/thread.md for what was implemented and any review outcomes.
2) Update plans/STATUS.md (mandatory):
   - Now: update Phase ID to reflect current state
   - Blockers: clear resolved blockers, add any new ones
   - Recent: summarize what was implemented, reviewed, and approved in this Phase
   - Next: indicate what happens next (documentation, phase approval, etc.)
3) Update plans/BACKLOG.md:
   - Remove completed items that were addressed in this Phase
   - Add any new items discovered during implementation or review
     (tech debt, follow-ups, non-blocking suggestions from code review)
   - Prioritize: P0 = do next, P1 = important, P2 = nice-to-have
4) Update plans/CHANGELOG.md:
   - Add an entry under "Unreleased" describing the Phase's changes
   - Include: what changed, key files affected, and brief rationale
5) Update plans/state.json:
   - last_action = PM.StatusUpdate
   - If documentation should be updated:
     - pause_type = "continue"
     - next_action_id = Writer.DocumentationUpdate
   - If documentation can be skipped (no user-facing changes):
     - pause_type = "continue"
     - next_action_id = Human.PhaseApproval
   - If a blocker is discovered:
     - pause_type = "decision"
     - next_action_id = Human.ResolveBlocker

Constraints:
- Do not implement code.
- Do not modify plans/MILESTONE.md (acceptance criteria stay as-is for Phase approval).
- Keep CHANGELOG entries concise — one to three bullets per Phase.
- Keep BACKLOG items actionable — no vague "improve X" without specifics.

Output:
- Brief summary
- Exact edits to plans/STATUS.md, plans/BACKLOG.md, plans/CHANGELOG.md, plans/state.json

ACTION: Human.ApproveMilestone
TYPE: Human-required (non-executable)

This action indicates the workflow is PAUSED for human review and approval of the milestone plan.

Your role as AI is NOT to approve the milestone.
Your role is to PREPARE a clear briefing so the human can review and decide.

Do NOT:
- Approve the milestone on the human's behalf
- Modify plans/MILESTONE.md
- Make scope decisions
- Update plans/state.json as if approved

Do:
- Summarize the milestone plan clearly
- Highlight key scope decisions and trade-offs
- Point to exact files and sections to review
- Specify what the human must update afterward

Inputs:
- plans/state.json
- plans/MILESTONE.md (the plan to review)
- plans/BUILD.md (overall Build context)
- plans/STATUS.md

Instructions:
1) Read plans/MILESTONE.md and summarize:
   - Milestone goal (one sentence)
   - Number of Phases and their names
   - Total acceptance criteria count
   - Any notable risks or dependencies
2) Highlight areas that need human attention:
   - Scope questions (is this the right amount of work?)
   - Phase ordering (does the sequence make sense?)
   - Acceptance criteria (are they sufficient?)
   - Missing Phases or over-scoped Phases
3) Produce a "Human Action Checklist":
   - Review plans/MILESTONE.md
   - Approve, request changes, or reject
   - If approved: update plans/state.json:
     - last_action = Human.ApproveMilestone
     - next_action_id = Staff.DraftQuestions
     - phase_id = P1
     - pause_type = "continue"
   - Update plans/STATUS.md with approval decision
   - If changes needed: update plans/state.json:
     - next_action_id = Principal.MilestonePlan (to re-draft)
     - Add notes to plans/thread.md with requested changes

Output format:
- A short briefing titled "Milestone Review Required"
- Summary of the milestone plan
- A checklist the human can follow
- Suggested state.json updates for each possible decision

Stop after producing the briefing.
Do NOT attempt to continue the workflow.

ROLE: Principal
TASK: CodeReview

Goal:
Review the most recent Staff implementation for correctness, clarity, and alignment with plans and standards.

This is a SINGLE micro-chunk review, scoped to the most recent Phase/Step.

Inputs:
- Code changes (git diff / commits)
- plans/MILESTONE.md (acceptance criteria)
- plans/DECISIONS.md (project-specific architectural choices)
- plans/STANDARDS.md (team-level rules portable across projects)
- plans/thread.md (review request)
- plans/STATUS.md
- plans/state.json

Instructions:
1) Review the implementation against:
   - Acceptance criteria in plans/MILESTONE.md
   - DECISIONS and STANDARDS
2) Write review feedback into plans/thread.md under the existing Review Request section.
   - Use clear bullets.
   - Distinguish:
     - REQUIRED changes (blocking)
     - SUGGESTED improvements (non-blocking)
3) Decide outcome:
   - APPROVED (no required changes)
   - CHANGES REQUIRED
   - BLOCKED (requires human/product decision)
4) Update plans/STATUS.md (mandatory):
   - Add a bullet summarizing review outcome
5) Update plans/state.json:
   - last_action = Principal.CodeReview
   - If APPROVED:
     - pause_type = "continue"
     - next_action_id = PM.StatusUpdate
   - If CHANGES REQUIRED:
     - pause_type = "continue"
     - next_action_id = Staff.ReviewReconciliation
   - If BLOCKED:
     - pause_type = "decision"
     - next_action_id = Human.ResolveBlocker
     - Add blocker(s) with clear summary

Constraints:
- Do not implement fixes yourself.
- Do not silently accept deviations from plans.
- If standards are unclear, call it out explicitly.

Output:
- Brief review summary
- Exact edits to plans/thread.md, plans/STATUS.md, plans/state.json

# SAM (Structured AI Method) — Micro-Chunk Workflow Template

SAM is a human-directed, AI-executed workflow for building software one small step at a time.

## Getting started

1. Copy the `plans/` folder into your project root
2. Read [`plans/README.md`](plans/README.md) — it explains everything

That's it. The README inside `plans/` is the full spec, quickstart, and reference.

## What's in this repo

| Path | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `plans/` | The reusable template — copy this into your project |
| `example/` | A worked example showing SAM in use (WIP) |
| `DECISIONS.md` | Design decisions about SAM itself (not part of the template) |
| `TODO.md` | Development backlog for SAM itself (not part of the template) |
